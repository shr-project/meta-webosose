#   1) Always use secondary display for launcher and applications.
#   2) Duplicate the first display into second even if enable ensureModeSet.
# We don't need them anyway for raspberrypi4 as the software decoding is being used.

# The patch below is raspberrypi4 specific to address an issue where the cursor
# on the first display is duplicated on the second at a very large magnification.
# Unlike other Raspberry Pi devices, Raspberry Pi 4 must use FKMS. This may be the
# cause of the problem.
# TODO: This patch will remove the artifact but another issue still exists where
# the cursor is suddenly appeared when moving it between displays.
