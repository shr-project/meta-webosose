Subject: [PATCH] input.py: Remove usage of 'U' mode bit for opening files in
 python

The 'U' mode bit is removed in python 3.11. It has been
deprecated for a long time. The 'U' mode bit has no effect
so this change doesn't change any behavior.

See https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#changes-in-the-python-api
