Subject: [PATCH] Correct pixelRatio for glyphs

:Release Notes:
Pixel ratio value is used for initialization material for glyphs
and if it is less than one (for example 0.9), by casting value to
integer we will get zero for pixelRatio and wrong material. As a result
glyphs are not drawn.

:Detailed Notes:
Device pixel ratio should be float value, but inside following function:
qsg_device_pixel_ratio it casts to integer. In later use returned from
mentioned above function value again casts to float.

Vertex shader for glyphs multiplies vertex coordinate value to
devicePixelRatio, but glyphs vertex coordinates are already
calculated with devicePixelRatio, so this additional multiplication
gives wrong scaling and positioning.

:Testing Performed:
webos-pro/master/886

:QA Notes:

:Issues Addressed:
[PLAT-1749] FPS number is not displaying
