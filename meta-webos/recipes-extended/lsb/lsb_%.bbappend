# lsb recipe was removed in Yocto 3.0 Zeus and replaced with just lsb-release in:
# commit fb064356af615d67d85b65942103bf943d84d290
# Author: Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de>
# Date:   Sun Aug 25 20:21:15 2019 +0300

#     Remove LSB support
#
# but backported keyutils recipe from Zeus already RDEPENDS on lsb-release
# provide it here, so that we don't need to modify backported keyutils
# and then this part can be dropped when renaming this from lsb to lsb-release in:
